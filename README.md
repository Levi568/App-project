<h1>IOS Application Project</h1>

### Test Version
IOS 12.1
Swift 4.2.1
 
### Objective
The App is built to detect the situations on the road and show the visualized accelerometer sensor results on the smartphone. I use IOS Mapkit API for the map and add UIcolors to leverage the different level of road surface flatness.
